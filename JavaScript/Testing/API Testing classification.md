Explaining 9 types of API testing.
 🔹 Smoke Testing This is done after API development is complete. Simply validate if the APIs are working and nothing breaks. 
 🔹 Functional Testing This creates a test plan based on the functional requirements and compares the results with the expected results. 
 🔹 Integration Testing This test combines several API calls to perform end-to-end tests. The intra-service communications and data transmissions are tested. 
 🔹 Regression Testing This test ensures that bug fixes or new features shouldn’t break the existing behaviors of APIs. 
 🔹 Load Testing This tests applications’ performance by simulating different loads. Then we can calculate the capacity of the application. 
 🔹 Stress Testing We deliberately create high loads to the APIs and test if the APIs are able to function normally. 
 🔹 Security Testing This tests the APIs against all possible external threats. 
 🔹 UI Testing This tests the UI interactions with the APIs to make sure the data can be displayed properly. 
 🔹 Fuzz Testing This injects invalid or unexpected input data into the API and tries to crash the API. In this way, it identifies the API vulnerabilities.
